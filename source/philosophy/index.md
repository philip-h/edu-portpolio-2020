#### Children are intelligent and loving creations of God.

We must, as educators, believe children to be inherently intelligent and inherently loving. When we believe children to be intelligent, we are not afraid to challenge their current limits, we are free to believe whole heatedly that children can excel in academics, even if they don’t believe it themselves. When educators believe students to be loving creations of God, we will be quick to love and slow to judge. We will be granted the ability to view the student and their achievements as connected, yet separate; if we can help students believe the same, they will develop a Growth Mindset.

#### Morals and Teachables.

As a Mathematics and Computer Science teacher, I will not be giving lectures on moral philosophy or preaching on the morality of news events. Instead, as a Catholic teacher, I will be instilling morals through my actions and responses. Morals are at the height of what any teacher could ever dream of instilling in their class, and I am no different.

#### Community is the foundation of Education.

Building a community in my classroom where students feel secure, brave, trusted, and loved is, as far as I am concerned, the surest way to learning in the classroom. When students feel this sense of community, classroom management becomes easier, honesty with your students becomes the norm, and their willingness to come to class greatly increases.

#### Catholic Graduate Expectations as a constant.

There is so much confusion in the world today surrounding Catholic Social Teaching, Catholic Education, and Catholic virtues in general. The Catholic Graduate Expectations provide every school in the board with consistency. When educators go against these expectations, all it accomplishes is an increase of confusion and doubt.

#### Audi alteram partem.

This roughly translates to: 'Listen to the other side'. As a camp counselor, I always hear stories from the ‘troubled youth’ about how they are always getting into trouble in their classes, even though, in their eyes, they did nothing wrong. I have always been confused about how anyone; parents, teachers, or on-lookers; could be so quick to judge without knowing all of the information. Going into education, I vowed to always listen to both sides of a story before making any decisions or judgments. As educators, we will be put into difficult situations, the worst thing we could do is to make a rash decision without the appropriate information.
