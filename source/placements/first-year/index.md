## first year
##### computer technology placement
#### first semester

My first-year placement was held at [St. Augustine’s Catholic Secondary School](https://www3.dpcdsb.org/AUGST) with a Computer Technology teacher as my mentor teacher (MT). It’s hard to describe the feeling of being placed in a school for the first time; a combination of terror and joy only begins to scratch the surface of how I felt walking into that school on that first Thursday. When I left high school in grade 12, no part of me could have imagined being a teacher. And yet, I stood in the middle of the main hall of the school, talking with my TC colleagues about how excited we all were to begin this new chapter in our lives.

During the first semester, my MT had grades 9, 11, and 12 classes. Due to the nature of Computer Technology, most of the lessons and assignments were project-based. That meant that there was not a lot of lecturing that went on in the classroom; instead, students were given instructions to learn about and research different parts of the computer and how they interacted with one another. Once researched, students would then get to physically handle the pieces of hardware they researched to see how they worked. My ‘job’ for most of the semester was to walk around the classroom and help out wherever needed, much like my MT did. It was an amazing experience of being able to use my acquired knowledge of computer systems to help students with their projects.

Throughout this semester, I got involved with the computer club wherein students would prepare for programming competitions. I also helped the librarian start a current events club where students would meet after school to discuss and debate upon current events in the news.

The highlight of this semester, however, was meeting the Computer Science teacher and being asked to teach a Game Maker lesson once a week. These lessons aimed to use the concepts and strategies learned in the Computer Science class in a concrete way: to make a video game. The students loved it, the Computer Science teacher loved it, and I got firsthand experience in assessment.  

#### second semester

The beginning of the second semester was much like the beginning of the first semester, except the terror had diminished significantly. My confidence as a teacher candidate rose in the second semester for a couple of reasons: an existing connection with staff and some students; smaller class sizes; more content knowledge.

My second semester taught me a lot about what it means to be a teacher. The Computer Science teacher (to clarify, not my MT) had a grate 10 locally developed this semester. Since my second teachable is math, my MT let me help out that class from time to time. This class was unlike any class I had ever been in. Growing up I was always in the academic stream, and so were all of my friends. I knew that essential streams existed, but I seldom spoke with anyone in the stream. This class taught me a lot about the aspects of teaching that go beyond content knowledge. I learned the importance of classroom management, the importance of making connections with the students, and the importance of respect in the classroom.

A favorite moment of mine was a day when the teacher for the grade 10 math class was away and there was a supply teacher. My MT asked me to help out the supply teacher for the day because there was a very small chance the supply teacher would know any math or coding. During the grade 10 math class, I had the amazing opportunity to work one-on-one with some of the students who didn’t want to do any work, while simultaneously talking to them about what they wanted to do in the future. I got to know the students quite well that day! I know there won’t be many situations like that again (that day, there were 4 students present out of the usual 7), but it made a lasting impression on me for sure.

My first-year practicum was an unforgettable experience. I was able to connect with many students, staff, and admin. I was able to be a part of two clubs. I was able to see, first hand, the value of having strong classroom management skills. I was able to thrive in my first-year placement.
