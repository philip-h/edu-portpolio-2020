## community placement

For my community placement, I was placed at the [Development and Peace](https://www.devp.org/en) HQ in Toronto. This community placement was an amazing experience.
We were tasked with planning, organizing, and running two large solidarity walks. There is a huge immigrant issue in the global south, and Pope Francis initiated a campaign called “Share the Journey”. The goal of this campaign is to globally walk the equatorial circumference of the earth in solidarity with all those who are forced to leave their countries on foot.

Throughout our placement, we also had the opportunity to provide two retreats for grade 7/8 classes to teach them about the realities of immigration, refugees, and the effects of war and terror. One activity we ran with the students was [A Refugee Simulation](https://www.devp.org/sites/www.devp.org/files/documents/thinkfast-activities/19-thinkfast_on_the_move.pdf). This simulation gave the students an interactive introduction to some of the realities of fleeing a country. Both the class and the teachers loved it.

This time at Development and Peace taught me something important. Students can act mature if the situation calls for it. At first, I was worried about using the Refugee Simulation with grade 7 students. I was worried that they wouldn’t take the activity seriously, which would downplay its entire purpose.  To my delight, the students participated in the activity wholly and maturely.

When we were not planning for any of the big events, we were helping D&P with their outreach to schools, spearheading the youth council, and learning about how, when we become teachers, we can use D&P’s resources to help our students.
