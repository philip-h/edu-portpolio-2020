## second year

#### first semester
##### mathematics placement

My first placement of the second year of Teacher's College was at St. Edmund Campion SS. The first day I was there, my MT was giving me a small tour of the school. As we passed by the Chapel, I got audibly excited and I noticed the chaplain look up from his desk. I had to keep moving, but I knew I would come back to see him. At the end of the day, I went back to the Chaplain and introduced myself. I asked if there was anything he needed help with, and before I knew it, I was helping out with the Chaplaincy every Tuesday.

That little story described a great start to an amazing semester. By the first day, I was teaching lessons and by the first week, I was planning my own lessons. I was very lucky to have such a supporting MT. In no time at all, my block was upon me and I had to prepare an entire unit. My block at St. Edmund Campion was one of the best experiences in all of Teacher’s College. Not only was I teaching every day, but I was creating the content I was teaching, and ensuring that the students were ready for assessments I was creating. I know they say that you are a teacher when you start your practicum, but it was not until this block that I truly felt like a teacher.

#### second semester block
##### computer science placement

The final placement in Teachers College! Not only did I have three other practicum’s worth of experience under my belt, but Computer Science is my primary teachable. Computer Science is the discipline I majored in at McMaster. It is the discipline I spent years trying to perfect throughout my life. I knew, before I even started, that it was going to be the best placement I’d ever have.

I was right - almost. By the end of the first week of my placement, I began to teach a unit I was creating from scratch. During this placement, I was really worried about my knowledge of the content. I wanted to make sure I got everything perfect. The big learning moment came when my MT pointed out to me that my knowledge on the content was solid, but that I really had to work on every other aspect of being a teacher: classroom management, attendance issues, cellphone use in class, even monitoring when students were to use the bathroom.

Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, my time at this placement was cut in half. I was hoping to come back after the March break to tackle all of the weaknesses I portrayed during the block. I helped my MT get set up with a virtual classroom environment, and as quickly as my block started, it ended. I was even helping the coach of the badminton team on the second last day of school. There was so much planned for part two of my block, but I am eternally grateful for the amazing experience I had during the first half.
