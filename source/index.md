    <h2>about me</h2>

First and foremost, I am a beloved child of God.

Also, I am a graduate of York University’s Bachelor of Education program and McMaster University’s Honors Computer Science program with a minor in Mathematics. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I volunteered at three catholic youth group programs and worked as a counselor at a stay-away summer camp named Camp Ozanam. Though I had a passion for Computer Science and technology, I had an even greater passion for learning with the youth. York allowed me to combine my love of teaching with my passion for Computer Science to make my current vocation a reality.

I currently enjoy thinking about and planning creative ways to share my knowledge of the field of Computer Science only slightly more than I love creating software that solves complex problems in a simple way. I have a passion for convincing everyone I meet that no one is a “math person” and that Maths is a beautiful and creative discipline.
